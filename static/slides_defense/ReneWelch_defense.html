The SNPs are correlated, 

- red -- `\(\rho \approx 1\)`

- blue `\(\rho \approx 0\)`

this makes to see cases, where an association is very significant due to the fact that the SNP is associated to another one that is the true causal.

# Fine-mapping methods

class: left, top

# What is a fine-mapping method?

- Methods to assign well-calibrated probabilities of  causality to a set of candidate variants (Spain &amp; Barrett, 2015)

- Methods using genotype data:

  - Most associated SNP
  - Sequentially conditioning on SNPs.

  &lt;!-- - BIMBAM, etc. --&gt;

- Methods using summary statistics:
$$
z | C = c \sim N( \Sigma \lambda_c , \Sigma )
$$
  - CAVIAR, (Hormozdiari et al, 2014 )
  
  - PAINTOR, prior over causal conf. depends on annotation data (Kichaev et al, 2014)
  
  - CAVIARBF, Bayesian fitting and numerical improvements (Chen et al, 2015 )

# Why do we need fine-maping methods?

- Adapting [Udler et al.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gepi.20504) test to a continuous phenotype:

&lt;img src="ReneWelch_defense_files/figure-html/power_calc-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- As `\(\rho\)` increases, more individuals are required to recognize the causal SNP

    - Data collection cost may become prohibitive, or
    
    - The population may not exists.

Can say, increase population size until we can distinguish the causal variant

how did we label the variants -&gt; to show what type of annotations we used

Two sequences:

  - Ref base + context
  - Alt base + context
  
Add min promoter + set of barcodes

# Annotation data: Allelic skew 

- Mask SNP positions in hg19 genome.

- For every ChIP-seq assay:

    1. Align reads to masked genome with [bowtie2](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml).
    
    2. Separate aligned reads with [SNPsplit](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/SNPsplit/). 
    
    3. Allocate unassigned reads to each allele with probability `\(0.5\)`.


- Define allelic skew for SNP `\(n\)`:

`\begin{aligned}
\text{allelic skew}_n  &amp;= \log_2\left(1 + \sum_a \mbox{alt}_{a,n} 1(\mbox{alt}_{a,n} \geq \mbox{ref}_{a,n}) \right) \\ &amp;\quad - \log_2\left(  1 + \sum_a \mbox{ref}_{a,n} 1(\mbox{alt}_{a,n} \leq \mbox{ref}_{a,n})\right)
\end{aligned}`

- We conjecture that by using this formula, we may be able to be avoiding "artificial ties"

Instead of trying to figure out the causal variants from the LD matrix, 
we use a stronger assumption.

1. The causal snp effects depend functionally on annotation data

2. After the causal variants are selected then the errors are independents

---
class: left, top

# FM-HighLD: Intuition

Consider a genomic region with `\(N\)` regulatory variants, clustered into `\(M\)` LD clusters of length `\(q_m\)` each. We want to estimate the two parameters `\(\mathbf{C}\)` and `\(\lambda\)`:

`$$\mbox{argmax}_{\mathbf{C},\lambda} L(\mathbf{C},\lambda) =\mbox{argmin}_{\mathbf{C},\lambda} \Vert \mathbf{C}^T( \mathbf{z} - \mathbf{A}\lambda  )\Vert^2$$`

.pull-right[

where:

- `\(\mathbf{C}\)` is the causal configuration matrix

- `\(\lambda\)` is the vector of coefficients

- `\(\mathbf{z}\)` is a vector `\(Q\)` summary statistics

- `\(\mathbf{A}\)` is the annotation matrix
]


--
Optimizing for `\(\mathbf{C}\)` and `\(\lambda\)` simultaneously is a hard problem.

# FM-HighLD: Model (Single-trait)

Let `\(m=1,\cdots,M\)` be the LD cluster, define the latent variable:

`\begin{aligned}
w_m \sim \mbox{Ber}(\pi) 
\end{aligned}`

Then, define the generative equations for candidate causals:

`\begin{aligned}
\tilde{z}_m \sim \begin{cases} N(0,\sigma_0^2),&amp; w_m = 0, \\ N(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_m\lambda, \sigma^2),&amp; w_m =1. \end{cases} \nonumber 
\end{aligned}`

The variance is derived from the models:

`\begin{aligned}
\mathbf{z} = \mathbf{A}\lambda + \epsilon.
\end{aligned}`

where `\(\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)`.

# FM-HighLD: Algorithm (Single-trait)
 
1. __E-step__: Using the causal candidates, calculate the posterior probabilities:
  
  \begin{aligned}
  \gamma_m = P(w_m = 1\mid \tilde{z}_m ,\mathbf{A}_m ) \propto \pi N(\tilde{z}_m\mid \tilde{\mathbf{A}}_m\lambda ,\sigma^2) 
  \end{aligned}

2. __M-step__: We pool the posterior probabilities into a weight vector `\(\Gamma\)`. The regression coefficient vector `\(\lambda\)`, and the error variance `\(\sigma^2\)` are estimated by fitting a weighted linear model with the `lm` function.

  For each LD cluster `\(m\)`, we pick the causal candidate as the SNP that is best represented by the annotation data:

`$$\mathbf{C}_m[k] =
  \begin{cases} 
    1 &amp; \text{if } k = \mbox{argmin}_{s} (z_m[s] - \mathbf{A}_m[s] \hat{\lambda})^2, \\
    0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}$$`

# FM-HighLD: Model (Multiple traits)

Let `\(t =1,\cdots,T\)` be the trait, and `\(m=1,\cdots,M_t\)` be the LD clusters for trait `\(t\)`, define the latent variables:

`\begin{aligned}
\text{Multiple traits: } &amp; w_{tm} \sim \mbox{Ber}(\pi) 
\end{aligned}`

Then, define the generative equations for candidate causals:

`\begin{aligned}
\text{Multiple traits: } \tilde{z}_{tm} \sim \begin{cases}N(0,\sigma_0^2),&amp;w_{tm} = 0, \\ N(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}_{tm}\lambda,\sigma^2 + \tilde{\mathbf{B}}_{tm}\Sigma \tilde{\mathbf{B}}_{tm}^T),&amp;w_{tm}=1. \end{cases}
\end{aligned}`

The variance is derived from the models:

`\begin{aligned}
\text{Multiple traits: } &amp; \mathbf{z} = \mathbf{A}\lambda + \mathbf{B} \mathbf{u} + \epsilon.
\end{aligned}`

where `\(\epsilon \sim N(0,\sigma^2)\)`, `\(u \sim N(0,\Sigma)\)`, `\(\Sigma = \mbox{diag}(\sigma^2_1,\cdots,\sigma^2_h)\)`, and `\(h\)` is the number of random effects.

# FM-HighLD: Algorithm (Multiple traits)
 
1. __E-step__: Using the causal candidates, calculate the posterior probabilities:
  
  `$$\gamma_{tm} = P(w_{tm} = 1\mid \tilde{z}_{tm} , \mathbf{A}_{tm})\propto \pi N(\tilde{z}_m\mid \tilde{\mathbf{A}}_m\lambda ,\sigma^2 + \tilde{\mathbf{B}}_{tm}\Sigma \tilde{\mathbf{B}}_{tm})$$`

2. __M-step__: We pool the posterior probabilities into a weight vector `\(\Gamma\)`. The regression coefficient vector `\(\lambda\)`, the error variance `\(\sigma^2\)` and the random effect variances `\(\Sigma\)` are estimated by fitting a weighted linear mixed model with the `lme4::lmer` function.

  For each trait, and each LD cluster `\(m=1,\cdots,M_t\)`, we pick the causal candidate for trait `\(t\)` as the SNP that is best represented by the annotation data:

`$$\mathbf{C}_{tm}[k] =
  \begin{cases} 
    1 &amp; \text{if } k = \mbox{argmin}_{s} (z_{tm}[s] - \mathbf{A}_{tm}[s] \hat{\lambda})^2, \\
    0 &amp; \text{otherwise.}
  \end{cases}$$`
  
  where `\([k]\)` denotes the `\(k\)`-th entry (row) of the vector (matrix). Finally, we construct `\(\mathbf{C} = \mbox{diag}(\mathbf{C}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{C}_M)\)`

---

# FM-HighLD: Pooling multiple loci

- For every loci, we fitted a latent model of the form:

`$$\begin{aligned}
    w_q &amp;\sim \mbox{Ber}(\pi) \nonumber \\
    z_q\mid w_q = 0 &amp;\sim N(0,\sigma^2_0) \\
    z_q\mid w_q = 1 &amp;\sim N( A_q^T\lambda , \sigma_{q}^2 ) 
\end{aligned}$$`

| **Group** | **Description** |
| ---- |:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| I    |  Both intercept and allelic skew coefficients `\(\geq0\)` |
| II   |  Intercept coefficient `\(&lt;0\)` and allelic skew coefficient `\(\geq0\)` |
| III  | Both intercept and allelic skew coefficients `\(&lt;0\)` |
| IV   | Intercept coefficient `\(\geq0\)` and allelic skew coefficient `\(&lt;0\)` |

- That way we can increase the number of fixed effects `\(p\)`, as `\(p\leq M\)`.

- __DeepSea scores__: Provides chromatin feature log fold change, computed by comparing the chromatin feature probabilities for sequences carrying the reference, and alternative alleles.

`$$s_{n,a} = \log \left(\frac{\mathbf{P}(\text{Assay }a\text{ carries ref allele at SNP }n  )}{\mathbf{P}(\text{Assay }a\text{ carries alt allele at SNP }n  )} \right)$$`

- __Peak overlaps__: ENCODE ChIP-seq peaks in GM12878,

`$$s_{n,a} = 1(\text{SNP}_n\text{ overlaps a peaks for assay }a)$$`

- __Modified scores__: We modified the sequence scores by multiplying the SNP score by a peak overlap indicator:

`$$\mathbf{a}_{n,a} = \mathbf{s}_{n,a}1(\text{SNP}_n \text{ overlaps a peak for assay }a)$$`

# Conclusions

- We evaluated fine-mapping methods with MPRA data for the first time, i.e. this is the first time that real data was used to evaluate multiple methods. But, as with any new technology we need to understand its limitations, and MPRA may introduce some difficulties as the assay's sensitivity is between 9% and 24%.

- __FM-HighDL__ is an integrative fine-mapping methods for variants in high LD, which works for both single and multiple traits cases. The key idea of the framework is that the causal SNPs summary statistics can be explained by annotation data.

- __FM-HighLD__ outperforms other methods:

  - When evaluating with simulated data.
  
  - When evaluating with eQTL data.

# Future work

1. Our methods optimizes a mixed continuous / combinatorial problem, it would be interesting to see how algorithms better suited for this kind of problems perform. For example, genetic algorithms.

2. Allow `\(&gt;1\)` causal SNPs per LD cluster. On one side, we can select the `\(h\)` smallest residuals per LD cluster, and create a matrix of `\(h\times q_m\)` for each LD cluster when building `\(\mathbf{C}\)`. But, extra assumptions will be needed for causal probabilities.

3. In theory, by adding a Laplace prior over the fixed-effects matrices it is possible to add model selection capabilities to __FM-HighLD__.

4. We were able to generate in-vivo annotation data, because LCL are very well studied. For rare diseases e.g. psychiatric diseases, there is not so much data. Perhaps, in the future with the development of single-cell ATAC-seq we will be able to apply __FM-HighLD__ to rare diseases.

5. Design features based on Hi-C data?

\hat{z}\mid C = c \sim N(\Sigma \lambda_c, \Sigma)
\end{aligned}`

where the entries of `\(\lambda_c\)` are the non-centrality parameters when causal and zero otherwise.
