Hello, my name is Rene Welch and I am working as an assistant scientist at the [CISR](https://cancer.wisc.edu/research/resources/cisr/). I did my Ph.D. at the Statistics Department at UW - Madison too, where I focused on developing computational tools for genomic data.

My research interests are:

- Data Integration in Computational biology.

- Reproducible research, and Data visualization
