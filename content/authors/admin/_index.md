I am an Assistant Scientist at the [CISR](https://cancer.wisc.edu/research/resources/cisr/) in the University of Wisconsin - Madison Carbone Cancer Center, and a Postdoc under the instruction of [Dr. Irene Ong](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~ong/). My research interests lie in the application of statistics to problems in computational biology, and lately I have been working on statistical methods for the analysis of microbiome data. I am also passionate in the creation of software to facilitate the analysis and interpretation of biological data.

I received my PhD in Statistics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison Department of Statistics where I worked with Dr. Sunduz Keles on problems arising in epigenetics, focusing on ChIP-seq, and ChIP-exo data.
