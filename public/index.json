A central goal in human genetics is to understand the function of such noncoding regions: given a region that is statistically associated with changes in gene expression (eQTL), does it in fact play a regulatory role? And if so, how is this role “coded” in its sequence? These questions were the subject of the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation eQTL challenge. Participants were given a set of sequences that flank eQTLs in humans and were asked to predict whether these are capable of regulating transcription (as evaluated by massively parallel reporter assays), and whether this capability changes between alternative alleles. Here, we report lessons learned from this community effort. By inspecting predictive properties in isolation, and conducting meta‐analysis over the competing methods, we find that using chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding as features in an ensemble of classifiers or regression models leads to the most accurate results. We then characterize the loci that are harder to predict, putting the spotlight on areas of weakness, which we expect to be the subject of future studies.","tags":null,"title":"Predicting gene expression in massively parallel reporter assays: A comparative study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anqi Wang","Rene Welch","Bo Zhao","Tram Ta","Sunduz Keles","Eric Johannsen"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1450656000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1450656000,"objectID":"b4daeae2e66130c757577d2dc2f3b771","permalink":"/publication/wang15/","publishdate":"2015-12-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/wang15/","section":"publication","summary":"Latent infection of B lymphocytes by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in vitro results in their immortalization into lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs); this latency program is controlled by the EBNA2 viral transcriptional activator, which targets promoters via RBPJ, a DNA binding protein in the Notch signaling pathway. Three other EBNA3 proteins (EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C) interact with RBPJ to regulate cell gene expression. The mechanism by which EBNAs regulate different genes via RBPJ remains unclear. Our chromatin immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis of the EBNA3 proteins analyzed in concert with prior EBNA2 and RBPJ data demonstrated that EBNA3A, EBNA3B, and EBNA3C bind to distinct, partially overlapping genomic locations. Although RBPJ interaction is critical for EBNA3A and EBNA3C growth effects, only 30 to 40% of EBNA3-bound sites colocalize with RBPJ. Using LCLs conditional for EBNA3A or EBNA3C activity, we demonstrate that EBNA2 binding at sites near EBNA3A- or EBNA3C-regulated genes is specifically regulated by the respective EBNA3. To investigate EBNA3 binding specificity, we identified sequences and transcription factors enriched at EBNA3A-, EBNA3B-, and EBNA3C-bound sites. This confirmed the prior observation that IRF4 is enriched at EBNA3A- and EBNA3C-bound sites and revealed IRF4 enrichment at EBNA3B-bound sites. Using IRF4-negative BJAB cells, we demonstrate that IRF4 is essential for EBNA3C, but not EBNA3A or EBNA3B, binding to specific sites. These results support a model in which EBNA2 and EBNA3s compete for distinct subsets of RBPJ sites to regulate cell genes and where EBNA3 subset specificity is determined by interactions with other cell transcription factors.","tags":null,"title":"Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigen 3 (EBNA3) Proteins Regulate EBNA2 Binding to Distinct RBPJ Genomic Sites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Zeng","Bo Li","Rene Welch","Constanza Rojo","Ye Zheng","Colin Dewey","Sunduz Keles"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1445299200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1445299200,"objectID":"07bac25fb1433c7d28be5f1ee359a4ab","permalink":"/publication/zeng15/","publishdate":"2015-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/zeng15/","section":"publication","summary":"Segmental duplications and other highly repetitive regions of genomes contribute significantly to cells’ regulatory programs. Advancements in next generation sequencing enabled genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq). However, interactions in highly repetitive regions of genomes have proven difficult to map since short reads of 50–100 base pairs (bps) from these regions map to multiple locations in reference genomes. Standard analytical methods discard such multi-mapping reads and the few that can accommodate them are prone to large false positive and negative rates. We developed Perm-seq, a prior-enhanced read allocation method for ChIP-seq experiments, that can allocate multi-mapping reads in highly repetitive regions of the genomes with high accuracy. We comprehensively evaluated Perm-seq, and found that our prior-enhanced approach significantly improves multi-read allocation accuracy over approaches that do not utilize additional data types. The statistical formalism underlying our approach facilitates supervising of multi-read allocation with a variety of data sources including histone ChIP-seq. We applied Perm-seq to 64 ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from GM12878 and K562 cells and identified many novel protein-DNA interactions in segmental duplication regions. Our analysis reveals that although the protein-DNA interactions sites are evolutionarily less conserved in repetitive regions, they share the overall sequence characteristics of the protein-DNA interactions in non-repetitive regions.","tags":null,"title":"Perm-seq: Mapping Protein-DNA Interactions in Segmental Duplication and Highly Repetitive Regions of Genomes with Prior-Enhanced Read Mapping","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"An R package to visualize ChIP-seq experiments across a set of pre-defined peaks.
