      <description>Genomic Wide Association Studies have robustly identified associations between phenotype and genotypes. However, these studies are hard to interpret as positions in the genome are usually correlated. For that purpose, we would like to compare the signalâ€™s strength and the correlation between the SNPs at the same time.
When I looked for tools to make these type of plots, I only found the LDheatmap which is capable of plotting the heatmap but not adding it to a manhattan plot.</description>
