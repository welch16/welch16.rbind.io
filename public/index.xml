      <description>Last week, I gave a presentation about developing R packages with Bioconductor. The slides are available here
 Besides the slides, I created a format based on the amazing ninjutsu, kunoichi with the Bioconductor colors.</description>

      <description>In my last project, I have been using the following function a lot:
load2env &amp;lt;- function(file,env = new.env()) { load(file,envir = env) env } This function load the RData file into the environment env, which will return. However, if we have multiple files to load simultaneously then we would like to load those files in parallel.
Using the new furrr or any other package that allows parallel processing, we can do that by using something as:</description>

      <description>Genomic Wide Association Studies have robustly identified associations between phenotype and genotypes. However, these studies are hard to interpret as positions in the genome are usually correlated. For that purpose, we would like to compare the signalâ€™s strength and the correlation between the SNPs at the same time.
When I looked for tools to make these type of plots, I only found the LDheatmap which is capable of plotting the heatmap but not adding it to a manhattan plot.</description>
